Tips:
• Heat oil till hot before cooking as this
will shorten cooking time and reduce the
amount of oil absorbed by the ingredients.
• Use unsaturated oils (e.g. sunflower oil,
canola oil, olive oil) instead of saturated
oils (e.g. ghee, butter, blended vegetable
oil) to reduce your risk of heart disease.
• Oily fish e.g. salmon, sardines and
mackerel contain omega-3 fatty acids
which help prevent heart disease
and stroke.

and hot water in a small bowl and whisk
until well blended.
